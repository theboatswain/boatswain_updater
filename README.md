# Auto Updater
Boatswain Auto Updater (BAT) is an open source, multiple platforms auto updater, which will ensure your clients always staying up-to-date with the newest version of your application. Although, BAT is a part of [Boatswain application](https://github.com/theboatswain/boatswain) but we have implemented it separately so that you can easily integrate it with your project, whether or not you are using python or any other languages.

## Introduction  
  
Boatswain Auto Updater is a PyQT based, cross-platform application, which allows you to deliver your newest version of your application to your clients. Relying on Github releases web service as backend APIs and hosting storage, you don't need to spend times to build up a Web API or spend a bunch of money to hire any sort of dedicate server for this. The implementation for BAT integration is super easy, just a few lines of code then you are ready to go ðŸ¥³

BAT works with or without super user privilege, depending the location of the installation folder. If you installed your application to user directory then the updating process will go smoothly, without asking anything. However, if you installed it into system directory (i.e **Windows**: *C:\Program Files\xxx*, **MacOS**: */Applications/xxx*, **Linux**: */xxx*) then a prompt asking for privilege permission will appear and the user just need to approve it, so then the updater will take care the rest.

## How does it work?
  
## Installation  
### For Python based application
If your project is using python, then add the following lines of code into your main application:
```python
from boatswain_updater.models.feed import Feed  
from boatswain_updater.updater import Updater

feed = Feed('<your github repo>')  #i.e theboatswain/boatswain
pixmap = QIcon(getExternalResource('<Your icon>')).pixmap(QSize(64, 64))  
update_dialog = Updater(None, feed)  
update_dialog.setIcon(pixmap)  
update_dialog.installed.connect(<function to call after finishing updating process>)  
update_dialog.checkForUpdate(silent=True)
```

And also put this line into your *requirements.txt* `boatswain_updater==1.1.3`
You can also take a look at BAT integration [here](https://github.com/theboatswain/boatswain/blob/master/boatswain/main.py#L74-L79) as reference.

### For non-python application
If your project is not using python, or incase you want to make things separately, you can also use the standalone version of Boatswain Auto Updater, which is implemented [here](https://github.com/theboatswain/boatswain_updater/blob/master/boatswain_updater/standalone.py). We have the [prebuilt versions of BAT standalone](https://github.com/theboatswain/boatswain_updater/releases), so, you just need to put it into your project and call it from your application. You can see the example of how it works in [https://github.com/theboatswain/updater_example](https://github.com/theboatswain/updater_example). Alternatively, you can also build BAT standalone from source.

BAT's documentation, user guide and other informations can be found at [https://github.com/theboatswain/boatswain_updater/wiki](https://github.com/theboatswain/boatswain_updater/wiki)  
  
## Building Boatswain  Auto Updater
BAT can be compiled and used on MacOS, Linux and Windows, both 32 bit and 64 bit systems. Tutorial for compiling hasn't finished yet, but you can refer to the one from Boatswain: [installation-mac.md](https://github.com/theboatswain/boatswain/blob/master/installation-mac.md) for MacOS,  [installation-debian.md](https://github.com/theboatswain/boatswain/blob/master/installation-debian.md) for Debian  and [installation-win.md](https://github.com/theboatswain/boatswain/blob/master/installation-win.md)  for Windows.
